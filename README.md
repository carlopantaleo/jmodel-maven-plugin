# JModel Maven Plugin

A Maven plugin to autogenerate a bunch of boilerplate code starting from a data model described in an XML file.

It generates:
- Java entity classes
- MyBatis mappers to persist those entity classes (not yet available)
- SQL schema files (DDLs) (not yet available)

Please note: this plugin is in early development: it has not been extensively tested and most features are missing. 
**DO NOT USE** in production until version 1.0.0 will be released.

Anyways, any contribution is well welcomed.
